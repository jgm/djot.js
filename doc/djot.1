.SH NAME
.PP
djot \[en] converts djot markup.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
djot options [file..]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
djot is a command-line parser for djot markup (https://djot.net).
It can produce
.IP \[bu] 2
an HMTL document (default behavior or \f[V]-t html\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
a stream of annotated tokens with byte offsets (\f[V]-t events\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
an AST in either human-readable or JSON form (\f[V]-t ast\f[R],
\f[V]-t astpretty\f[R]).
.IP \[bu] 2
a djot document (\f[V]-t djot\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
a pandoc AST serialized to JSON (\f[V]-t pandoc\f[R]), which can be read
by pandoc and converted to many other formats
.PP
It can also read a JSON-serialized djot AST (\f[V]-f ast\f[R]) or a
pandoc AST serialized to JSON (\f[V]-f pandoc\f[R]), allowing conversion
from many other formats.
.PP
Finally, it can apply \f[I]filters\f[R] that modify the parsed AST
between the parsing and rendering steps.
This is the primary way in which djot syntax can be customized.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[V]--to,-t\f[R] \f[I]FORMAT\f[R]
Specify format to convert to.
Valid values are \f[V]html\f[R] (the default), \f[V]ast\f[R]
(JSON-formatted AST), \f[V]astpretty\f[R] (human-readable AST),
\f[V]events\f[R] (JSON array of events produced by the tokenizer),
\f[V]djot\f[R] (djot markup), or \f[V]pandoc\f[R] (JSON serialized
pandoc AST).
.TP
\f[V]--from,-f\f[R] \f[I]FORMAT\f[R]
Specify format to convert from.
Valid values are \f[V]djot\f[R] (the default), \f[V]ast\f[R]
(JSON-formatted AST), and \f[V]pandoc\f[R] (JSON serialized pandoc AST).
.TP
\f[V]--filter\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R]
Read a filter from \f[I]FILE\f[R] and apply it to the parsed AST prior
to rendering.
This option may be used multiple times; the filters will be applied in
the order specified on the command line.
See FILTERS below for details.
.TP
\f[V]--compact\f[R]
Use compact JSON for the AST, with no extra spacing for readbility.
.TP
\f[V]--width,-w\f[R] \f[I]NUMBER\f[R]
Text width to which to wrap output of \f[V]-t djot\f[R].
If \f[I]NUMBER\f[R] is 0, no wrapping will be done, and line breaks in
the input will be preserved in the output.
If it is -1, no wrapping will be done, and line breaks in the input will
be treated as spaces.
.TP
\f[V]--sourcepos,-p\f[R]
Include information about the start and end positions of elements in the
HTML and AST.
Source positions include the line number, column number (counting UTF-16
code units, which might not accord with visible columns), and character
offset in the entire document (again, in UTF-16 code units).
.TP
\f[V]--time\f[R]
Print timings for parsing, filtering, and rendering to stderr.
.TP
\f[V]--quiet\f[R]
Suppress warnings.
.TP
\f[V]--version\f[R]
Print version
.TP
\f[V]--help,-h\f[R]
Print this message.
.SH FILTERS
.PP
Filters are JavaScript programs that modify the parsed document prior to
rendering.
Here is an example of a filter that capitalizes all the content text in
a document:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
// This filter capitalizes regular text, leaving code and URLs unaffected
return {
  str: (el) => {
    el.text = el.text.toUpperCase();
  }
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Save this as \f[V]caps.js\f[R] use tell djot to use it using
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
djot --filter caps input.js
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note: never run a filter from a source you don\[cq]t trust, without
inspecting the code carefully.
Filters are programs, and like any programs they can do bad things on
your system.
.PP
Here\[cq]s a filter that prints a list of all the URLs you link to in a
document.
This filter doesn\[cq]t alter the document at all; it just prints the
list to stderr.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
return {
  link: (el) => {
    process.stderr:write(el.destination + \[dq]\[rs]n\[dq])
  }
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
A filter walks the document\[cq]s abstract syntax tree, applying
functions to like-tagged nodes, so you will want to get familiar with
how djot\[cq]s AST is designed.
The easiest way to do this is to use \f[V]djot --ast\f[R] or
\f[V]djot --astpretty\f[R].
.PP
By default filters do a bottom-up traversal; that is, the filter for a
node is run after its children have been processed.
It is possible to do a top-down travel, though, and even to run separate
actions on entering a node (before processing the children) and on
exiting (after processing the children).
To do this, associate the node\[cq]s tag with a table containing
\f[V]enter\f[R] and/or \f[V]exit\f[R] functions.
The \f[V]enter\f[R] function is run when we traverse \f[I]into\f[R] the
node, before we traverse its children, and the \f[V]exit\f[R] function
is run after we have traversed the node\[cq]s children.
For a top-down traversal, you\[cq]d just use the \f[V]enter\f[R]
functions.
If the tag is associated directly with a function, as in the first
example above, it is treated as an \[ga]exit\[cq] function.
.PP
The following filter will capitalize text that is nested inside
emphasis, but not other text:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
// This filter capitalizes the contents of emph
// nodes instead of italicizing them.
let capitalize = 0;
return {
   emph: {
     enter: (e) => {
       capitalize = capitalize + 1;
     },
     exit: (e) => {
       capitalize = capitalize - 1;
       e.tag = \[dq]span\[dq];
     },
   },
   str: (e) => {
     if (capitalize > 0) {
       e.text = e.text.toUpperCase();
      }
   }
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
It is possible to inhibit traversal into the children of a node, by
having the \f[V]enter\f[R] function return the value true (or any truish
value, say \f[V]\[dq]stop\[dq]\f[R]).
This can be used, for example, to prevent the contents of a footnote
from being processed:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
return {
 footnote: {
   enter: (e) => {
     return true
    }
  }
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
A single filter may return a table with multiple tables, which will be
applied sequentially:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
// This filter includes two sub-filters, run in sequence
return [
  { // first filter changes (TM) to trademark symbol
    str: (e) => {
      e.text = e.text.replace(/\[rs]\[rs](TM\[rs]\[rs])/, \[dq]\[tm]\[dq]);
    }
  },
  { // second filter changes \[aq][]\[aq] to \[aq]()\[aq] in text
    str: (e) => {
      e.text = e.text.replace(/\[rs]\[rs](/,\[dq][\[dq]).replace(/\[rs]\[rs])/,\[dq]]\[dq]);
    }
  }
]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Here is a simple filter that changes letter enumerated lists to
roman-numbered:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
// Changes letter-enumerated lists to roman-numbered
return {
  list: (e) => {
    if (e.style === \[aq]a.\[aq]) {
      e.style = \[aq]i.\[aq];
    } else if (e.style === \[aq]A.\[aq]) {
      e.style = \[aq]I.\[aq];
    }
  }
}
