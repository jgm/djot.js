# djot.js

A library and command-line tool for parsing and
rendering the light markup format [djot](https://djot.net).

This is a typescript rewrite of [djot's original lua
implementation](https://github.com/jgm/djot.lua).
It is currently powering the [djot
playground](https://djot.net/playground).

## Script API

These are available after you run `npm install`, which will
install the library's build dependencies:

| `npm run ...`    | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | -----------                                    |
| `build`          | Compile and bundle sources to `lib` and `dist` |
| `test`           | Run tests                                      |
| `bench`          | Run benchmarks                                 |

## Installing the command line utility

You can install the command-line utility `djot` via

```
npm install -g @djot/djot
```

`djot --help` will give a summary of options. For more
extensive documentation, use `man djot` or see the
[man page online](https://github.com/jgm/djot.js/blob/main/doc/djot.md).

You can use `djot` to

- convert from djot to HTML
- show the low-level event stream generated by the djot parser
- show the AST produced by the djot parser, in JSON or compact form
- convert from a JSON-formatted djot AST to djot or HTML
- alter the AST using filters
- convert from djot to pandoc JSON which can be read by pandoc
- convert pandoc JSON (or djot) to djot

For example, to convert a `gfm` document `mydoc.md` to djot,

```
pandoc mydoc.md -f gfm -t json | djot -f pandoc -t djot > mydoc.dj
```

And to convert back to `gfm`,

```
djot mydoc.dj -t pandoc | pandoc -f json -t gfm
```

## Library API

### Parsing djot to an AST

`parse(input : string, options : ParseOptions = {})`

Example of usage:

``` js
djot.parse("hello _there_", {sourcePositions: true});
```

`options` can have the following (optional) fields:

- `sourcePositions : boolean`: include source positions in the AST
- `warn : (message : Warning) => void`:
  function used to handle warnings from the parser.

A warning can be rendered using the `render()` method, so
to render warnings to the console, for example, you could do:

```
{ warn: (warning) => console.log(warning.render()) }
```

Alternatively, you can directly access the fields
`message` (string), `offset` (number if defined),
and `pos` (`{ line: number, col: number, offset: number }` if defined).

### Parsing djot to a stream of events

`new EventParser(input : string, options : Options = {})`

Exposes an iterator over events, each with the form
`{startpos : number, endpos : number, annot : string}`.
Example of usage:

```js
for (let event in new djot.EventParser("Hi _there_")) {
  console.log(event)
}
```

The `Options` object has a `warn` property as described for `parse`,
above.

### Pretty-printing the djot AST

`renderAST(doc : Doc) : string`

Example of usage:

``` js
console.log(djot.renderAST(djot.parse("hi _there_")));
```

### Rendering the djot AST to HTML

`renderHTML(ast : Doc, options : HTMLRenderOptions = {})`

`HTMLRenderOptions` extends `Options` with an `overrides`
field, which maps node tags to overrides for their renderers.

Example of usage:

``` js
console.log(djot.renderHTML(djot.parse("- _hi_",{sourcePositions:true})));
```

Simple example of an override:

``` js
djot.renderHTML(
  djot.parse("_hi_"),
  { sourcePositions: true,
    overrides: {
      emph: (node, renderer) => {
        return
          `<span class="emphasized">${renderer.renderChildren(node)}</span>`;
      }
    } });
```

This yields: `<span class="emphasized">hi</span>`.

### Rendering djot

`renderDjot(doc : Doc, options : DjotRenderOptions = {}) : string`

`DjotRenderOptions` extends `Options` with a `wrapWidth : number` field.
Its effect is as follows:

- `wrapWidth > 0`: Output is wrapped to fit in the width, with `soft_break'
  acting like a space.
- `wrapWidth = 0`: Output is not wrapped; `soft_break` renders
  as a line break.
- `wrapWidth = -1`: Output is not wrapped; `soft_break` renders
  as a space.

Example of usage:

``` js
console.log(djot.renderDjot(djot.parse("_Hello_ world"), {wrapWidth: 64}));
```


### Pandoc interoperability

`toPandoc(doc : Doc, options : PandocRenderOptions) : Pandoc`

`PandocRenderOptions` extends `Options` with
`smartPunctuationMap`, which has the form and default values:

``` js
{ non_breaking_space: " ",
  ellipses: "⋯",
  em_dash: "-",
  en_dash: "-",
  left_single_quote: "‘",
  right_single_quote: "’",
  left_double_quote: "“",
  right_double_quote: "”" };
```

Example of usage:

``` js
console.log(JSON.stringify(djot.toPandoc(djot.parse("- one\n- two\n"))));
```


`fromPandoc(pandoc : Pandoc, options : Options) : Doc`

Example of usage:

``` js
let ast = djot.fromPandoc(JSON.parse(pandocJSON));
```

### Filters

`applyFilter(node : Doc, filter : Filter)`

Example of usage:

``` js
const capitalizeFilter = () => {
  return {
           str: (e) => {
             e.text = e.text.toUpperCase();
           }
  };
};
let ast = djot.parse("Hi there `verbatim`");
djot.applyFilter(ast, capitalizeFilter);
```

Filters are JavaScript programs that alter the AST between
parsing and rendering. They can be used for customization.

Here is an example of a filter that
capitalizes all the content text in a document:

```js
// This filter capitalizes regular text, leaving code and URLs unaffected
return {
  str: (el) => {
    el.text = el.text.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

Here's a filter that prints a list of all the URLs you
link to in a document.  This filter doesn't alter the
document at all; it just prints the list to stderr.

```js
return {
  link: (el) => {
    process.stderr:write(el.destination + "\n")
  }
}
```

By default filters do a bottom-up traversal; that is, the
filter for a node is run after its children have been processed.
It is possible to do a top-down travel, though, and even
to run separate actions on entering a node (before processing the
children) and on exiting (after processing the children). To do
this, associate the node's tag with a table containing `enter` and/or
`exit` functions.  The `enter` function is run when we traverse
*into* the node, before we traverse its children, and the `exit`
function is run after we have traversed the node's children.
For a top-down traversal, you'd just use the `enter` functions.
If the tag is associated directly with a function, as in the
first example above, it is treated as an `exit' function.

The following filter will capitalize text
that is nested inside emphasis, but not other text:

```js
// This filter capitalizes the contents of emph
// nodes instead of italicizing them.
let capitalize = 0;
return {
   emph: {
     enter: (e) => {
       capitalize = capitalize + 1;
     },
     exit: (e) => {
       capitalize = capitalize - 1;
       e.tag = "span";
     },
   },
   str: (e) => {
     if (capitalize > 0) {
       e.text = e.text.toUpperCase();
      }
   }
}
```

A single filter may return a table with multiple tables, which will be
applied sequentially:

```js
// This filter includes two sub-filters, run in sequence
return [
  { // first filter changes (TM) to trademark symbol
    str: (e) => {
      e.text = e.text.replace(/\\(TM\\)/, "™");
    }
  },
  { // second filter changes '[]' to '()' in text
    str: (e) => {
      e.text = e.text.replace(/\\(/,"[").replace(/\\)/,"]");
    }
  }
]
```

The filters we've looked at so far modify nodes in place by
changing one of their properties (`text`).
Sometimes we'll want to replace a node with a different kind of
node, or with several nodes, or to delete a node.  In these
cases we can end the filter function with a `return`.
If a single AST node is returned, it will replace the element
the filter is processing.  If an array of AST nodes is returned,
they will be spliced in to replace the element.  If an empty
array is returned, the element will be deleted.

```js
// This filter replaces certain Symb nodes with
// formatted text.
const substitutions = {
  mycorp: [ { tag: "str", text: "My Corp" },
            { tag: "superscript",
              [ { tag: "str", text: "(TM)" } ] } ],
  myloc: { tag: "str", text: "Coyote, NM" }
  };
return {
  symb: (e) => {
    const found = substitutions[e.alias];
    if (found) {
      return found;
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// This filter replaces all Image nodes with their descriptions.
return {
  image: (e) => {
    return e.children;
  }
}
```

It is possible to inhibit traversal into the children of a node,
by having the `enter` function return an object with the
property `stop`. The contents of `stop` will be used as the regular
return value. This can be used, for example, to prevent
the contents of a footnote from being processed:

```js
return {
 footnote: {
   enter: (e) => {
     return {stop: [e]};
    }
  }
}
```


## The AST

The most human-readable documentation for the djot AST format
is the [typescript type
definitions](https://github.com/jgm/djot.js/blob/main/src/ast.ts).

There is also a [JSON
schema](https://github.com/jgm/djot.js/blob/main/djot-schema.json)
which can be used to verify conformity to the AST programatically.
